# Person-Retrieval-AVSS-2018
Implementation of our [IEEE AVSS 2018](https://dblp.org/db/conf/avss/avss2018.html) paper ["Person Retrieval in Surveillance Video using Height, Color, and Gender"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8639145). If you find this code useful in your research, please consider citing:

This code was initially tested on an Ubuntu 16.04 system using Keras 2.0.8 with Tensorflow 1.12 backend.

**The paper proposes a deep learning-based linear filtering approach for person retrieval using height, cloth color, and gender.**  

## Installation  

1) Clone this repository.  
```
git clone https://github.com/Vanditg/Person-Retrieval-AVSS-2018.git  
```  

2) In the repository, execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the necessary libraries.  

3) Three deep learning models are used inorder to filter out the desired person.  
	1) *Mask_RCNN:- Used to determine the coordinates of the person and fetch the pixelwise segmentation*  
	2) *gender_model:- Used to determine gender of the person*  
	3) *color_model:- Used to determine torso color of the person*  

4) Download the pretrained weights.
	1) Mask_RCNN [pretrained weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IQKvcGuxvT80dqWLDzRKmF-wsmDKzxnG?usp=sharing) and save it in root directory  
	2) gender_model [pretrained weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IQKvcGuxvT80dqWLDzRKmF-wsmDKzxnG?usp=sharing) and save it in /modalities/gender/  
	3) color_model [pretrained weight](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IQKvcGuxvT80dqWLDzRKmF-wsmDKzxnG?usp=sharing) and save it in /modalities/torso_color/   

### Usage

To use run
```
python Video_demo_person_identification.py
```  
This will read the input video file and based on the queries produces the Bounding-Box and Person Coordinates text file under the output folder.  

Many thanks to [Matterport](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN) for the Mask R-CNN code.
